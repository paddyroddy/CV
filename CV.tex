	%	COMPANY SPECIFIC
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	I am writing to you to seek an internship this summer at the end of my fourth year at university. The opportunity to work, and develop my skills at Redgate is something that really excites me.
	
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Studying Natural Sciences at Cambridge University; after a more broad range of science in the first two years, I chose to specialise in Astrophysics. Within my studies, I find the computer simulations on astrophysical situations particularly interesting. The combination of the numerical simulations with the theoretical calculations - to see the validity of the models and how they apply to real astrophysics - is fascinating.
	
	I am now in the fourth year of my course for which I will achieve an MSci in Natural Sciences. My research project is titled \emph{Lyman Alpha Profile of Simulated Galaxies} which is very computational in nature. I wish to continue research in the form of a PhD in theoretical cosmology. During the past three summers, I have participated in three internships in different aspects of engineering. The latter two have provided me with a good base in software development in the professional workplace. 
	
	I am a member of CUAS (the astronomical society) and CUPS (the physics society) which allows me to attend talks at the forefront of science. Further to this, through CUAS, I have access to the university telescopes dating back to 1833 which I find fascinating. Currently I do occasional work for the Institute of Astronomy as an outreach supervisor in which we give the public, and small community groups, the chance to learn a bit about astronomy. We have access to a modern 16inch telescope for the groups to give them an insight into observing.
	
	I'm heavily involved in sport, achieving Full Blue status as a cross country runner at Cambridge. Now as the Club Captain of the Hare \& Hounds, I have a leading role in the development of the team. I train every day for running and triathlon and it forms a large part of my university life and helps me deal with the demanding course. Having begun running in 2011, it quickly became a large part of me as a person, developing my ability to stick to intense schedules and improving my focus. I compete in all forms of running including road from 5km to the half marathon – having achieved number 1 rank for an U20 in the UK in 2015 for the latter - and in the winter months cross country - coming \nth{89} \& \nth{44} in the senior Nationals \& UKCAU championships respectively in 2016.
	
	I am very involved in Scouting having been a scout from the age of 6 and continue to be a scout leader with a local scout troop. I've been through the entire Scouting system from Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Explorers \& now as a member of Network and a Leader when I am available. Through my work as an outreach supervisor, I also give local Scouting/Guiding groups the opportunity to learn some astronomy and have a go at observing. Through Scouting I have gained the top awards, including the Queen's Scouts award, the Gold Duke of Edinburgh award, and the Explorer Belt.
